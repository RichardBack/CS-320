•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?  
      Ensuring that your code, program, or software is functional and secure requires following important security measures or best practices, such as coding correctly (Brathwaite, 2021). Good coding practices can help prevent security vulnerabilities, which may be difficult to fix later on. It's crucial to build the program with security measures in mind right from the start. Adhering to a set of best practices when writing code can help ensure that your code, program, or software is functional and secure. For instance, you should never hard-code login credentials or any sensitive information into your code (Brathwaite, 2021). Hackers can use "brute force" methods to compromise user passwords, so implementing lock-out functionality with a strong password that meets specific criteria (i.e., 12-16 characters long with capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and a special character) can prevent this from happening (Brathwaite, 2021). In addition, it's advisable to include two-factor authentication as a log-in option and randomize session IDs to make your tokens unpredictable (Brathwaite, 2021). Never trust user input, as vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, SQL injections, and buffer overflows can result from this (Brathwaite, 2021). Validating that the data is in the correct format for every field on an input form can prevent these vulnerabilities. Also, limit the information revealed in error codes, and never disclose details about the inner workings of your program (Brathwaite, 2021). Fuzzers can test whether your program can handle any type of user input by providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs (Brathwaite, 2021). This allows you to identify any security issues within your program. Other types of automated tools, such as static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST), can scan your code and test it at runtime for security issues (Brathwaite, 2021).
•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?  
    	Understanding the needs of the user is a crucial aspect of product development. The first step towards achieving this is to involve users in the design phase. This allows them to see what is being designed and whether it meets their requirements (Campbell, 2019). The next step is to identify any problems that users might have with the product (Digital Transformation Agency, 2019). By identifying these problems early, you will have enough time to investigate and resolve them (Digital Transformation Agency, 2019). To define the user's needs, you can test your hypothesis through various methods such as interviews, surveys, and research (Nikolaieva, n.d.). While conducting research, try to keep it broad and include not just users of your software but also users of other software (Campbell, 2019). Introducing story mapping to software users can be helpful in identifying features to test and manage release dates for the software. To create a story map, write down user stories on post-it notes, providing a visual aid for developers to understand the user's needs (Campbell, 2019). Finally, analyze the information gathered from users. Pay attention to what you have been told and ask yourself who the users of the program are, what changes need to be made, why the users want these changes made, and how to make the changes. Throughout the entire development process, from initiation and road-mapping to acceptance testing, include users in all phases of development (Campbell, 2019).
•	How do I approach designing software?
 	    Design is a critical phase of the software development methodology as the entire program will be built based on the choices made in the design phase (Takyar, 2022). To organize, coordinate, classify, and set up software design's structural components, many principles are employed, such as modularity, coupling, abstraction, anticipation of change, simplicity, and sufficiency and completeness (Takyar, 2022). The stages of software design include understanding project requirements, research and analysis, design, prototyping, and evaluation (Takyar, 2022). Before starting the software design, it is essential to understand all project requirements to avoid overlooking users' inputs and not addressing all aspects of their pain points and difficulties (Takyar, 2022). Research and analysis, which is the second stage, involve reaching out to a targeted audience to create user personas, analyze collected data, and determine user design basics and requirements through methods such as interviews, focus groups, and surveys (Takyar, 2022).	Once research and analysis are completed and data is gathered and analyzed, the design of the software is the next stage. The design stage includes wireframing, creating user stories, data flow diagrams, technical design, and user interface (Takyar, 2022). Wireframing is used to decide the basic structure, elements, features, navigation, and look of the software, and it acts as the "skeleton" of the software design (Takyar, 2022). User stories are written from the user's point of view and should convey how the user will employ the software, be simple, clear, easily available, and cover the users' requirements (Takyar, 2022). Data flow diagrams show the different levels of concepts in the system, and technical design lists every technical detail of the software design, including hardware components and their functions, functions of the software elements, order of aspects of software, data structures, and data flow (Takyar, 2022). User interface comprises all parts of the software that a user can interact with, including Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), Voice Controlled Interfaces (VUI), and Gesture-Based Interfaces (Takyar, 2022). Stage four of the software design process involves creating a prototype or draft of the product, which serves as a visual representation of the finished product. There are three types of prototyping: low fidelity, medium fidelity, and high fidelity (Takyar, 2022).
 	The final stage is the evaluation stage, which involves user testing to assess the extent to which the user requirements have been fulfilled. It is important to test and retest the software design to ensure that it is smooth, simple, and all requirements have been met (Takyar, 2022). The evaluation stage is critical in detecting any design problems and debugging the system before it is launched (Takyar, 2022).
